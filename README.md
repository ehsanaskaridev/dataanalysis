# Dataset Analysis
In this project, we wrangle through a dataset and draw some charts to warm up and get a sense of what it is like to data engineering projects. The dataset we use is 6000 reviews of some popular messenger apps on play store. We use the `pandas` and `plotly` libraries to manipulate and visualize data.
## Setting up the environment
We use `pipenv` to create a virtual environment and manage packages.
1. If you dont have the `pipenv` installed, install it using the following command
```
   pip install pipenv
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. active the virtual environment
```
   pipenv shell
```
4. Install packages
```
   pipenv install
```
5. open Jupyter Notebook
```
   pipenv run jupyter notebook
```
